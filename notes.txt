- I'm confusing for loops running time with that of animations. The animations run after the for loops are done executing. The for loops run faster than animations, they don't run in realtime.
I forgot that I was assigning the 'onfinished' events in the for loops, which means they run after the loop is completed, not while the loop is running.
REMEMBER TO ALWAYS CONSIDER THE ORDER OF EXECUTION OF STATEMENTS. IT CAN SAVE YOU A LOT OF HEADACHE

I am a software developer with a great passion for writing. I have nine (9) years of experience in software development working on many small projects utilising several different technologies including recent innovations such as Augmented Reality (AR), and Progressive Web Applications (PWAs). My main area of focus has been creating educational applications with web technologies.

I have read numerous programming tutorials, documentation, blog posts and articles, and so, I have become very familiar with the writing styles, technical jargon and overall quality of written content in the field. I have learned how to avoid common mistakes and how to use the most effective ways of communicating these technical ideas to readers.

I use my excellent written English skills to document the things I learn during projects, so they can be of help to those who need it. I put a lot of effort into making my writing understandable to my readers without sacrificing elegance or the technical nature of the subject.

I am proficient in JavaScript and HTML; I can write CSS comfortably.
I can also write basic programs with Python, Java, C and PHP

My interests are:
HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Progressive Web Apps (Offline-first)
Game development and design
Data Structures and Algorithms
Augmented Reality (AR)
Low-level programming
WebAssembly

I frequently read articles on these areas of Computer Science:
Programming Languages
Memory Management
Compilers
Cybersecurity

I also read about blockchain from time to time.
