# DSAViz
DSAViz is a web app that contains simple simulations of selected data structures and algorithms.

For now, there's only a simulation of the linear search algorithm.

I plan to create simulations of these algorithms and data structures in the near future:
* Binary Search
* Queues
* Selection Sort

I know I said simulations too many times. Sorry about that ðŸ˜…
