# DSAViz
DSAViz is a web app used for visualising simple data structures and algorithms.

It currently contains a simplified simulation of the linear search algorithm.

I plan to create simulations of these algorithms and data structures in the near future:
* Binary Search
* Queues
* Selection Sort

I know this README is boring. Sorry about that, I don't have much to say ðŸ˜…
